JSF/Spring E-Commerce portal

Simplyfied and updated version of my old project: https://sourceforge.net/projects/igdo/ <br />
Little post about it: https://intelligentjava.wordpress.com/2014/07/17/why-mistakes-are-good/

It is JSF 2.2 / Spring / Hibernate / MySql Ecommerce website. Unfortunately never finished. Its not tested and bugs were not fixed and after migration probably much more bugs appeared. However I feel it might be nice place to take a look if you are working on something similar.<br/>
